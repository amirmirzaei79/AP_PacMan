# PacMan

Second Project of advanced programming course at KNTU.

This is a simple pacman game developed using java and javaFX.

Depending on your version of JRE you might have to configure javaFX additionally to run the game.

### Instructions

The GUI is pretty self explanatory and guides you throw. This part is just for explaining input keys.

In all of the game modes 'P' or Space key will pause the game. Pressing them again will resume your game. While game is paused you can save it using 'S' key. Saving will rewrite your last save so if you want your last save, save the SaveFile.ser in another place for later use.

In all both single player modes pacman is controlled using arrow keys.

In Two Player modes left player controls his pacman using **WASD keys** and right player using **arrow keys**.
